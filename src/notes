Redux has three process 
which are actions => reducer => store.

The store is Just a place that handles all the state the app need. 
when creating a store it takes a reducer as it first argument.

const store = createStore(rootReducer); 

The reducer is just a pure function in react and their produce new states when there is an 
update in the state of the app. One principle of redux is never to mutate states. so the initial state of 
your app should never be changed.

For the reducer to function it needs an action.
The action is just an object, it defines the kind of operation it wants to execute.
It is best practice to put the actions in a function.

For an action to occur redux uses the dispatch function to trigger an  action.
You can access the current state of the application using getState()
Redux implements the subscribe to listen for changes.
